The following script converts all the frames in all the binary files in one 
directory to an  image and a binary file containing the intensity data of the
experiment. 
This program is meant to be run in spyder because in its console
the progress bar shows. The progress bar will show up after each step in 
iPython and after the entire program finishes in Python.
