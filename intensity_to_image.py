The following script converts all the intensity data in one 
directory to an  image.
This program is meant to be run in spyder because in its console
the progress bar shows. The progress bar will show up after each step in 
iPython and after the entire program finishes in Python.
Functions are not meant to be exported to other programs, as they depend on
global variables in this program.
